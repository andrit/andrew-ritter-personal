       Helping a non-profit to increase their visibility is rewarding indeed.

        <strong>As a Web Designer</strong> I installed WordPress and configured it via plugins and theme customization for <a href="http://suss.capsli.org" target="_blank">SUSS</a>.  I built out the pages of the site, adding a jumbo slider on the front page with CSS animations.<br />
        <strong>As a Documentarian</strong> I set up the lighting, sound and video for a short interview with the director of the SUSS program and edited it using Premeire Pro and After Effects for lower thirds and the motion graphics title screen.  I then uploaded it to the <a href="http://suss.capsli.org/about-us" target="_blank">About Us page.</a>

          I gathered the background information about the purpose and the drive at SUSS and using this info, I guided the project's inception by informing which framework and what theme to employ.  
      </p>
      <p>
          Again my experience with WordPress served me well as I was able to quickly develop the pages and transcribe the collected information into the site's flow.

          Being that SUSS is such a strongly person-to-person project, it only makes sense to have a personalized introduction to the program.
      </p>
      <p>
          While the program offers a great amount of guidance and interactivity within, creating an interface wherein those ideas come out to the visitor was a pivotal move in the UI of the site. 
      </p>
      <p> So we created a short video to introduce the program to visitors.  I shot the video and edited in Adobe Premiere Pro and created lower thirds and motion graphics titles in After Effects.</p>
