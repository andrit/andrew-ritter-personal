       Scarlet Heifer Advertising is big on the story in the design and the brand.  I participated in developing, producing and editing some of those stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>As a Web Site Builder</strong>  I streamlined the transmission of communication, be it about current accomplishments on client projects or the aim of the future of the company, so that Scarlet Heifer was ever more sharp in their campaign to change the world.<br />
        <strong>As a Videographer</strong> I handled an HD camera through the streets of NYC and on a tripod in interviews.  I set up the lighting and sound and also worked on some of the post production work.
