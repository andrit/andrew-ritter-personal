        <strong>As a blog writer</strong> I wrote blog entries that explored the technology being used to create client work.  It was largely an effort to establish the company as an expert in the field. I also created all of the graphics to accompany each entry.<br />
        <strong>As a photographer</strong> I captured imagery that showed the company participating in industry events.  I also captured product imagery for several clients.
      </p>

        <strong>As a graphic designer</strong> I created a new logo to brand the company as a far-reaching company that could 'power on' their clients online presence.  I added that logo to business cards, flyers, letterhead and envelopes. I also participated in the building of several WordPress websites.
