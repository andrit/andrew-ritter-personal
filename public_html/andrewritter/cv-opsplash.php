        Protecting the Bays of Long Island is what Operation Splash is all about.  I helped them to get the word out!

        <strong>As a Web Designer</strong>  I crafted the website, <a href="http://operationsplash.com" target="_blank">OperationSplash.com</a> to show their wealth of content and informational pieces in a uniform and well-designed way using the WordPress CMS, HTML, and CSS.<br />
        <strong>As a Digital Consultant</strong> I directed graphics creation workflows and instructed other team members on best practices for development and upkeep of the digital property that is the website.

          I got to use my CSS skills to create styles that formalized the design of the many pages on Operation Splash's website
      </p>
      <p>
          My CSS skills were particularly handy when faced with some requested design changes that required advanced selections.

          They say the sign of an expert is one that knows what not to do, but it is also about knowing what to do without doing the wrong thing.  My experience with WordPress helped the team to quickly get the content onto the site so that we could begin to form it.
