          I create and/or edited dozens of CSS style rules.  On the maintenance side of it, I made changes with the use of complex selectors
      </p>
      <p>
          For landing pages I created custom styles to place and style different elements of the pages and created internal styles for HTML emails.

          Using UX strategies and tactics such as copy decks, user flow, competitor research, stakeholder interviews, I planned and redesigned the interface of arbitrationlaw.com and jurisconferences.com
      </p>
      <p>
          <a href="http://arbitrationlaw.com" target="_blank">Arbitrationlaw</a> is a multifaceted web site and I worked to bring that out in the redesign of the homepage, several internal pages and creation of new landing pages and user flow pages.  <a href="http://jurisconferences.com" target="_blank">Jurisconferences</a> is an event site and I set up a slider to highight new events and added new sidebars and highlight sections to bring in related materials and social media connections.
